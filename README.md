# Crime Prediction for the TTC Using RNN

With the rise in crime on the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and limited budgets, there is a need for intelligent and cost-effective public safety planning. This project uses historical crime data from 2014â€“2023 to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically an LSTM model, to forecast crime trends for the first half of 2024 (January to June) in the 10 most affected Toronto neighbourhoods.

## Datasets Used

<details>
<summary>1. <strong>Major Crime Indicators Dataset</strong> ([Toronto Police Service](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/major-crime-indicators))</summary>

- Crimes from Jan 2014 to Dec 2023 (~400,000 records)
- Filtered for crimes related to the TTC
- Focused columns:
  - `OCC_DATE` (occurrence date)
  - `NEIGHBOURHOOD_158` (Toronto neighbourhood)
  - `MCI_CATEGORY` (crime type): Assault, Robbery, Auto Theft, Theft Over, Break and Enter
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. <strong>Neighbourhood Spatial Data</strong> ([City of Toronto](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhoods/))</summary>

- Used for heatmap visualization
- Contains Toronto's official neighbourhood boundaries
</details>

## Implementation Steps

<details>
<summary>Data Preprocessing</summary>

- Filtered to include only TTC-related incidents
- Dropped unnecessary columns
- Aggregated crimes monthly by neighbourhood
</details>

<details>
<summary>Exploratory Analysis</summary>

#### Crime Category Trends by Location

- **Crime Types by Neighbourhood:**  
  A multi-line graph visualizing how different types of crime (e.g., Assault, Robbery, etc.) vary over time for the most affected neighbourhoods.  
  ![Crime Types Over Time](Figures/output.png)

#### Top 10 Locations by Crime Count

- **Top 10 Crime Locations:**  
  A bar chart showing which Toronto neighbourhoods had the highest number of TTC-related crimes.  
  ![Top 10 Crime Locations](Figures/top_10.png)

#### Monthly Crime Count Trends

Each of the top 10 neighbourhoods had its TTC crime data grouped and visualized by month (2014â€“2023). This helped identify seasonal trends and prepare input for the LSTM model.

<details>
<summary>Model: LSTM (RNN)</summary>

- Grouped monthly counts as time series
- Used `TimeSeriesGenerator` with batch size = 4 (chosen based on testing different values)
- Dataset split:
  - 70% Training (2014â€“2020)
  - 20% Validation (2021â€“2022)
  - 10% Test (2023)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Loss Function</summary>

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Chosen for penalizing large errors

## Model Results

The following heatmap shows predicted crime levels (Janâ€“June 2024) across Toronto neighbourhoods. Darker regions indicate higher expected crime rates based on the RNN model.  
![PredictedCrime](Figures/TTC_Predicted_Crime.gif)

The final predicted crime trends can be seen over in the following graph.  
![PredictedCrimeFig](Figures/predicted_crime.png)

Other findings:
- The model performs reasonably well for trend prediction, especially in consistent neighbourhoods.
- MSE values vary per neighbourhood.  
  **Example:**
```
Annex: 10.08
Rosedale-Moore Park: 6.72
Etobicoke City Centre: 2.56
```
---

## Key Insights

- **Annex** and **Rosedale-Moore Park** require the most urgent resource allocation.
- Crimes at the Annex are predicted to rise sharply.
- Most future crimes are expected to be **assaults**.
- Predictions suggest targeted safety investments like more safety officers or emergency buttons, especially in the Annex.

---

## Limitations

- Small dataset (only ~120 monthly records per location)
- COVID-19 likely skewed 2020â€“2022 trends. This is also a problem because 2020-2022 years are used for data validation as well. 
- No data scaling or transformer models due to resource constraints

---

## Future Work

- Integrate input scaling
- Explore ARIMA models for comparison
- Expand predictions to all 158 neighbourhoods
- Compare predicted vs. actual results after June 2024

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

- **Major_Crime_Indicators_Open_Data.csv**:  
Original dataset by the Toronto Police Service which contains information on reported crimes. Please note the dataset is updated periodically; however, for this project, the dataset used is up to the end of December 2023.

- **Data Preprocessing.ipynb**:  
Takes the original dataset and creates a new CSV keeping only the rows related to crime incidents that happened on the TTC. Produces `Processed_crime_dataset.csv`.

- **Processed_crime_dataset.csv**:  
Resulting dataset after initial processing, which involves removing all rows that arenâ€™t related to TTC. This dataset, containing ~11,000 records, is used for data analysis and modeling.

- **TTC Crime Model Implementation.ipynb**:  
Contains all code for the initial analysis of data (including identifying the top 10 most problematic neighbourhoods), graphing trends, training the RNN model, and visualizing crime on a map.

- **Neighbourhoods.geojson**:  
Original dataset by the City of Toronto Open Data with information on all of Torontoâ€™s neighbourhoods. Used by GeoPandas for mapping neighbourhoods in the visualizations.
